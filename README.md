Please see the training program detailed below.  This should give the skills and knowledge to work in SharePoint and also should you leave the university give you the confidence of what you have learned that you apply in your new work place.

I have created 3 sites that we can use to learn together on, we can use OneNote for your notes.  As you are busy, this will be at your pace, so when you both have free time then we can either do online or free room within faculty start covering some of the topic listed below, some will be short, some may take longer to cover, and some might need a couple sessions on but keep track of where we are and if we use teams will can also record the sessions so you can re-watch them.

This will require commitment from both of you, and it could take months to complete as we are fitting it around your schedule but hopefully worth it.  Let me know your thoughts if you want to proceed I go ahead and create the class notebooks and provide you access to the sites below and then wait for you to confirm dates and times for sessions working through the order set out below:
